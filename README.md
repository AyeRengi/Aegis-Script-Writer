# Aegis-Script-Writer
Easily create scripts for DigiKeyboard (digispark) or convert Ducky Script to digispark working script!
Open source, created this in little time (was rushed) so code is a mess and not documented. maybe later on when I have time I'll convert it to OOP and make it nice and neat but as of now you'll have to deal with the mess :3

Also if you want to open a already existing digispark script just drag and drop it on the text area where the you can see the script!

Just download the exe: https://mega.nz/#!Cf421BKb!viqHtG7i307oXFphj3ZZTEKzDBq6r38hub7C7bvqRIU
